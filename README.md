## Features

### Feature 1: Books

The user can read the information for all current books on both the splash/home page of the application (pics 1 and 2), as well as on each book's individual book details page (3 & 4). The user can also upload a book (upper-portion of upload modal shown in pic 5) as well as edit and delete books they have uploaded.

## Future Implementation Goals

### Search Cart

The user will be able to create a search cart for purchasing items, add books to the search cart, see what books are in the search cart, and delete the search cart/specific items in it.

### Wishlist

The user will be able to create a wishlist for books he is interested in, add books to the wishlist, see what books are in the wishlist cart, and delete the wishlist/speicifc items in it.

### Bonus1: AWS

AWS functionality for adding book photos and review photos.

### Bonus2: Search

A search feature for finding books- at least by title- possibly also by author, genre, and other fields.

### Possible refactor: Membership in place of Books
Books may be used purely as seed data.  In place would be a memberhsip feature where the user can select a membership, read details of the membership, and calcel/delete the membership.  There would be a relationship with the cart functionality here as the user would be able to purchase books at a reduced, membership-only price.
